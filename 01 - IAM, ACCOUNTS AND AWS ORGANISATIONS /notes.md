# IAM, ACCOUNTS AND AWS ORGANISATIONS

## IAM Identity Policies

IAM Policies are a type of policies that get attached to an Identity within AWS.

*Identities* = IAM Users, IAM Groups, IAM Roles

An IAM Policy is a set of Security Statement to AWS, that grants/deny access to any Identity that uses that Policy.
They're created in JSON, containing multiple statements.

> **IMPORTANT** If there are multiple statements in a Policy, then **ALL** statements will be processed and applied.
These rules are applied with a defined priority:

1. Explicit Deny
2. Explicit Allow
3. Implicit Deny

If Identities are not explicitly allowed access, then they're not allowed allowed any access to anything.
**Exception** = Root Account

There are 2 main types of policies:

1. Inline Policies
    - Individual JSON, applied individually to an Identity
    - Used for exceptions to any standard scenario
2. Managed Policies
    - Policy that can be attached to any Identity that might need them.
    - Should be used as a Default
    - They are Reusable
    - They offer Low Management Overhead

## IAM Users and ARNs

IAM users are an Identity use for anything requiring AWS Access. e.g. Humans, Applications, Service Accounts.

IAM starts with a *principal*.

A *principal* can be anything, but in order to be able to do anything, it needs to authenticate against an Identity within IAM.
Authentication is done via *Username and Password* or *Access Keys*.
Once a principal authenticates, it's now an *authenticated identity*.

Once it's an *authenticated identity*, then it will have to be authorised via *policies* applied to it.

### Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

ARNs uniquely identify resources within any AWS Account.

ARNs are connection of fields, split by a colon. If you see a double colon, then it mean that that specific field doesn't need to be specified.

A * can be used, which is a wildcard.

![ARN-1](https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac03/blob/main/0600-IAM_ACCOUNTS_ORGS/00_LEARNINGAIDS/IAMUsers-2.png?raw=true)

> The top ARN refers to the **Bucket**
> The bottom ARN refers to the **Objects** in the bucket, and **NOT** the Bucket itself.

### Exam PowerUps

- Max 5000 IAM users per AWS Account
- a IAM User can be a member of 10 IAM Groups

## IAM Groups

IAM Groups are containers for IAM Users.
You **can't login** to IAM Groups, and they've got no credentials of their own.

> An IAM user can be a member of multiple IAM Groups.

Groups can have policies attached to them, both:

- Inline Policies
- Managed Policies

Policies will merge; collect all the Allows + Denies, and the same hierarchy applies here; an Explicit Deny will always win over an Explicit Allow.

> There's no All Users Group (like in Azure) as Default/Natively.

Groups **DO NOT** allow nesting, there's no concept of group within a group.

Groups are limited to 300 Groups/account, but they can be increased with a support ticket.

![IAMGroups-1](https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac03/blob/main/0600-IAM_ACCOUNTS_ORGS/00_LEARNINGAIDS/IAM-Groups-1.png?raw=true)

> **Groups are NOT a TRUE Identity! They can't be referenced as a Principal in a policy.**

## IAM Roles

A role is a type of Identity that exists within AWS.
IAM Roles are best suited to be used by multiple Principals (users, service accounts, etc.).

IAM Roles are often used on a temporary basis.

A User can assume a Role, and assume its rights temporarily.

![IAMRoles-1](https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac03/blob/main/0600-IAM_ACCOUNTS_ORGS/00_LEARNINGAIDS/IAMRoles-1.png?raw=true)

IAM Roles have 2 type of policies that can be attached:

- Trust Policy
  - Control which Identities can assume that role
  - It can reference Identities in the same account AND in other AWS Accounts.
  - It can allow anonymous usage of that role.
- Permission Policy
  - Define what resources can be accessed by an identity that assumes that role.

If a role is assumed by an Identity that's allowed to assume it, it will generate **temporary security credentials** for it. These credentials are generated by the **STS** Service.
Temporary credentials are like Access Keys, but they're time based, as they can and will expire.
This Temporary Credentials will be able to access resources defined within the **Permission Policy**.

> Roles are REAL Identities, and as such they can be accessed within Resource Policies.

![IAMRoles-2](https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac03/blob/main/0600-IAM_ACCOUNTS_ORGS/00_LEARNINGAIDS/IAMRoles-2.png?raw=true)

Roles are used within an AWS Organisation to access different accounts, without having to login with multiple accounts every time.
